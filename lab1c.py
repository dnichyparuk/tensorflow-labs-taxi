#Challenge Exercise
#Create a neural network that is capable of finding the volume of a cylinder given the radius of its base (r) and its height (h). 
# Assume that the radius and height of the cylinder are both in the range 0.5 to 2.0. Simulate the necessary training dataset.

#Hint 
# #The input features will be r and h and the label will be  𝜋𝑟2ℎ  Create random values for r and h and compute V. 
# Your dataset will consist of r, h and V. Then, use a DNN regressor. Make sure to generate enough data.
